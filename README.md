# Handling Skewed Data Using Transformations

This project demonstrates how to identify and correct skewed distributions in real-world data using logarithmic and power transformations. The Ames Housing dataset is used to showcase both visual and performance-based improvements in predictive modeling through feature engineering.

## Dataset

- **Name:** Ames Housing Dataset
- **Source:** [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=ames)
- **File:** AmesHousing.csv

## What You'll Learn

- How to detect skewness in numerical features
- When and how to apply log and Yeo-Johnson transformations
- Visualization of data distributions before and after transformation
- How feature transformation improves linear regression performance
